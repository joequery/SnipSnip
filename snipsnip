	=========================== MENU FUNCTIONS =========================== 
		We now define a group of functions we'll call menu functions. These menu
	functions essentially define the type of selections the user will be able
	to make. Below these menu function definitions is a menu mapping function 
	called	get_next_menu which dictates which menu the user will be 
	redirected to after	making a selection from the current menu. 
		It's important to note that not all 'menus' will actually be the 
	standard menu where you are given a list of items to select from. Some
	menus may simply display information or may request user input, and would
	be better defined as 'screens'. In fact, it may actually be worthwhile to
	rename 'menu' to 'screen' throughout the codebase to avoid this confusion
	since all menus are screens but not all screens are menus. 

	Each menu function should have a parameter of argList (explained below)
	and return a 3-tuple of (index, selection, pushPop)

	index: index serves two roles. On the surface, index is just the index
	of the selected item from an itemList. However, since almost all programs
	need to establish a 'terminating menu' where the user can only stay in 
	the current window or go back to previous ones, we use the index as a form
	of navigation as well. Throughout the program, a returned index of -1 
	indicates	that the user should be redirected back to the previous menu.
	Consider a simple phonebook application. Eventually the user will need to
	input data for a new telephone entry. Clearly no selection from a menu is
	being made at the moment they put in an entry, but to keep consistent 
	with our get_next_menu mapping, we need	to return SOME index. In some
	instances, -2 is used to indicate a forced exit.

	selection: In the event of a standard menu, selection should return the
	string value of the selection. In the event of a non-standard menu (such
	as a screen for user input or information display), the selection value is
	irrelevant and any arbitrary value will work.

	pushPop: Probably the most complicated of the tuple is the pushPop return 
	value. pushPop can be one of three values: False, None, and True. 
	Each menu function will be passed an argument list named argList. 
	The pushPop value determines how to manipulate the argList list before
	we go to the next menu.

		If pushPop is:
		True: Append the current menu's returned selection value to the argList
		so the next menu will have access to the value.

		False: Pop the last argList value, removing the previous menus' value in
		the argList (if any was provided)

		None: Pass the argList as is to the next menu function.

	As an example, consider an application that stores the users physical
	address and contains the following menus:
		stateMenu,
		cityMenu,
		getStreetAddressInput
		confirmAndSave

	From stateMenu, the user selects the state they live in. This data will
	be needed by cityMenu to build a list of possible cities, so pushPop for
	stateMenu should be True so the selected state value is appended to the 
	argList and is this made available to the cityMenu.

	Since the users city will be stored, we need to add the selected city
	to the argList so we'll have access to it in the confirmAndSave screen.
	Thus, the cityMenu pushPop value should be True. This scenario is 
	exactly the same for getStreetAddressInput and should also return a 
	pushPop value of True.

	Finally, the confirmAndSave menu allows the user to save the data. Since
	this is a 'terminating menu' (there are no more menus 'after' this), we 
	don't need to append the selection of value (something like "Yes, I 
	confirm this data is correct") to the argList. This the pushPop value of 
	confirmAndSave is None.

	Whenever possible, use the simple_menu function defined below for 
	standard menus.
